# Documentation Gap Analyzer

Analyze my codebase structure to identify documentation gaps and prioritize content creation needs. For this analysis:

1. Outline a workflow where AI scans repository structure, README files, and code comments to map existing documentation
2. Design a system to generate a "documentation health score" for different components
3. Create a prioritization framework that considers factors like code complexity, user impact, and update frequency
4. Suggest an AI workflow that could automatically generate draft outlines for missing documentation
5. Propose methods to integrate this analysis into CI/CD pipelines for ongoing documentation maintenance
6. Include a template for a documentation gap report that could be generated weekly

For each part of this workflow, specify which elements should be handled by AI and which require human review or input, with clear handoff points.
