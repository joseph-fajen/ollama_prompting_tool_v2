# Knowledge Base Synthesizer

Create a workflow that uses AI to extract, organize, and synthesize institutional knowledge from various sources into a cohesive technical knowledge base. Design a system that:

1. Mines information from Slack conversations, emails, issue trackers, and meeting notes
2. Identifies valuable technical insights, solutions, and decisions
3. Structures this information into a searchable, categorized knowledge base
4. Generates appropriate documentation formats for different types of knowledge
5. Implements a verification workflow where subject matter experts can validate AI-extracted content
6. Continuously updates the knowledge base as new information becomes available

Include prompt strategies for extracting high-quality information from informal communications and methods to preserve context when formalizing casual explanations.
