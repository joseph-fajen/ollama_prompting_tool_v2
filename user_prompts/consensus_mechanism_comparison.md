Create a comprehensive comparison of the three major consensus mechanisms (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delegated Proof of Stake) suitable for inclusion in a technical blog post. The comparison should:

1. Explain each mechanism's fundamental principles and how they secure the blockchain
2. Analyze their respective advantages and limitations regarding:
   - Energy consumption and environmental impact
   - Security properties and attack vectors
   - Scalability and transaction throughput
   - Decentralization and governance implications
3. Provide real-world examples of major blockchains using each mechanism
4. Discuss emerging hybrid approaches and future directions
5. Include a summary table that allows for quick reference and comparison

The content should be technically accurate while remaining accessible to readers with intermediate blockchain knowledge. Use analogies where helpful for complex concepts.
