# Code-to-Documentation Pipeline Designer

Design an automated workflow that transforms code into comprehensive documentation with minimal human intervention. The workflow should:

1. Extract function signatures, parameters, and return types directly from code
2. Analyze inline comments and convert them into proper documentation
3. Generate usage examples based on test files
4. Identify edge cases and common errors from error handling code
5. Create appropriate structure and navigation for the resulting documentation
6. Include a mechanism for human reviewers to validate and enhance AI-generated content
7. Implement versioning that keeps documentation synchronized with code changes

Include specific prompt templates that developers could use at different stages of this pipeline, and suggest tools that could be integrated for a seamless experience.
