Create a technical explanation of smart contracts for a white paper aimed at business executives with minimal blockchain experience. The explanation should:

1. Define what smart contracts are and how they function
2. Explain their advantages over traditional contracts
3. Outline key limitations and potential risks
4. Provide a simple example of a smart contract in action (escrow use case)
5. Include a brief section on security considerations

The explanation should be approximately 500-700 words, maintain a professional tone, and avoid unnecessary technical jargon while still being precise.
