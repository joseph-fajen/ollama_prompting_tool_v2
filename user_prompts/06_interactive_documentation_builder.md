# Interactive Documentation Experience Builder

Design an AI workflow that transforms static documentation into interactive learning experiences. Create a system that:

1. Analyzes existing documentation to identify concepts that benefit from interactive examples
2. Generates working code samples that users can execute in a sandbox environment
3. Creates guided walkthroughs with progressive disclosure of complex concepts
4. Develops interactive troubleshooting decision trees based on common user issues
5. Implements personalized learning paths based on user roles and experience levels
6. Provides mechanisms for collecting and incorporating user feedback

Detail the specific AI prompts and tools needed at each stage, and outline how content creators would collaborate with the AI system to develop these interactive experiences.
