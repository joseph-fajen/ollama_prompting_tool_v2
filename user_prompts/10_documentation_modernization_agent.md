# Documentation Modernization Agent

Design an AI workflow to modernize legacy documentation, transforming outdated formats and content into contemporary, maintainable documentation. Create a system that:

1. Analyzes existing documentation to identify outdated information, broken links, and obsolete formats
2. Extracts still-relevant content while flagging information that needs subject matter expert review
3. Restructures content following modern documentation best practices
4. Updates terminology, screenshots, and examples to reflect current product state
5. Implements proper versioning and a maintainable content structure
6. Suggests areas where new content types (video, interactive examples) would enhance understanding

Include a phased approach for tackling large documentation sets and methods to preserve valuable historical context while updating technical information.
