# Multi-Persona Documentation Generator

Create a workflow that uses multiple AI "personas" to generate complementary documentation tailored to different audience needs. Design a system where:

1. A "Developer Persona" creates technical API references with implementation details
2. A "Solution Architect Persona" develops integration guides and architectural overviews
3. A "New User Persona" produces getting started guides and tutorials
4. A "QA Persona" generates troubleshooting guides based on common issues

For each persona, define:
- The specific documentation artifacts they would produce
- The source materials they would need
- The unique prompt engineering approach for that persona
- Methods to ensure consistency across documentation created by different personas
- How human reviewers would interact with each persona

Include a coordination mechanism to ensure all documentation components work together as a cohesive system.
