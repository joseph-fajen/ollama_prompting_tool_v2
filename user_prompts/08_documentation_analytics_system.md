# Documentation Analytics and Improvement System

Design an AI-powered system that analyzes documentation usage and effectiveness, then recommends and implements improvements. Create a workflow that:

1. Integrates with analytics to identify most and least-viewed documentation pages
2. Analyzes user search queries to identify information needs
3. Evaluates documentation complexity and readability for different audience segments
4. Identifies content that frequently leads to support requests
5. Automatically generates improvement suggestions for problematic content
6. Implements A/B testing for different documentation approaches
7. Creates an ongoing optimization loop based on real user behavior

Detail how this system would balance automated improvements with human oversight, and include specific metrics for evaluating documentation effectiveness.
