# Technical Onboarding Content Generator

Create an AI workflow that generates personalized onboarding documentation for new team members based on their role and the projects they'll be working on. Design a system that:

1. Analyzes repository activity and codebase structure to identify key components relevant to specific roles
2. Creates role-specific technical orientation guides with increasing levels of detail
3. Generates personalized learning paths through existing documentation
4. Develops guided exercises that help new team members become productive quickly
5. Adapts content based on the technical background of the new team member
6. Updates automatically as projects evolve

Include prompts for generating different components of the onboarding experience and methods to incorporate feedback from recently onboarded team members.
