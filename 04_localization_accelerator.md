# Technical Content Localization Accelerator

Design an AI-enhanced workflow for efficiently localizing technical documentation into multiple languages while preserving technical accuracy. The workflow should:

1. Identify technical terms, product names, and branded elements that should remain untranslated
2. Generate a specialized technical glossary for each target language
3. Create context-aware translation prompts that maintain the meaning of technical concepts
4. Implement a quality assurance process that validates technical accuracy post-translation
5. Design a feedback loop where human reviewers can improve future AI translations
6. Enable simultaneous updates across all language versions when source documentation changes

Include specific considerations for languages with different technical vocabulary traditions and reading directions.
