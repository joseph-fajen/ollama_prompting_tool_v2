# Documentation-Driven Development Assistant

Create a workflow that implements documentation-driven development practices using AI assistants. Design a system where:

1. Technical requirements are translated into documentation outlines before coding begins
2. API endpoints and data structures are documented and reviewed through AI-generated mock documentation
3. AI assists in generating tests based on documented expectations
4. Code implementation is guided by and checked against the pre-written documentation
5. Discrepancies between implementation and documentation are automatically flagged
6. The entire process maintains documentation as the single source of truth

Include prompts for each stage of this workflow and describe how developers, technical writers, and AI assistants would collaborate throughout the development lifecycle.
