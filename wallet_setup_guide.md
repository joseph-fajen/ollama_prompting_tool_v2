Create a step-by-step guide for setting up a blockchain wallet for first-time cryptocurrency users. The guide should:

1. Begin with a brief explanation of what a blockchain wallet is and why it's needed
2. Include instructions for both mobile and desktop options
3. Explain the critical importance of private key security and backup phrases
4. Address common security concerns and best practices
5. Include warnings about common scams and how to avoid them
6. End with next steps after wallet creation (receiving/sending tokens)

Format the guide with clear headings, numbered steps where appropriate, callout boxes for critical security information, and include specific points where screenshots would be helpful in the final document.
