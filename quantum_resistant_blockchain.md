# Quantum-Resistant Blockchain Analysis

Provide a detailed technical analysis of quantum-resistant cryptography for blockchain systems. Include:

1. An explanation of the quantum computing threat model to traditional blockchain cryptography (specifically addressing vulnerabilities in ECDSA and other commonly used algorithms)
2. A comparative analysis of leading post-quantum cryptographic approaches (lattice-based, hash-based, multivariate, and code-based) with their respective advantages and limitations for blockchain implementation
3. The mathematical principles behind at least two specific quantum-resistant signature schemes (e.g., XMSS, SPHINCS+, Dilithium)
4. Implementation considerations and performance metrics (key sizes, signature sizes, verification times) for quantum-resistant solutions in blockchain contexts
5. The current status of standardization efforts and notable blockchain projects that have implemented or are developing quantum-resistant solutions
6. A technical risk assessment timeline for when quantum computing might pose a realistic threat to existing blockchain systems

Include relevant mathematical notation where appropriate and address the technical tradeoffs in terms of security parameters, computational overhead, and practical deployment strategies.
